Purpose:
Implements linear and binary search algorithms for product search functionality.

Used In:
ECommerceSearch.java

Technical Highlights:

Linear Search: Simple iteration through the Product[] array.

Binary Search: Performed on sorted products by productId using Comparator.

Demonstrates the importance of search efficiency and data preprocessing (sorting).

Benefits:

Useful for comparing algorithmic performance (O(n) vs O(log n)).

Forms the foundation for building search engines, filters, and recommendation systems.
