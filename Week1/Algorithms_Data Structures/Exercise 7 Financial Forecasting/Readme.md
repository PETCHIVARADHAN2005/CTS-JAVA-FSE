Purpose:
Demonstrates recursive and iterative techniques to compute compound interest over time.

Used In:
FinancialForecasting.java

Technical Highlights:

Recursive function models compound calculation using method calls.

Iterative function uses a loop for performance efficiency.

Uses Java's Scanner for input and NumberFormat for currency formatting.

Benefits:

Provides insight into time complexity and space tradeoffs in recursion vs iteration.

Suitable for basic financial simulations or time-based data projection.
